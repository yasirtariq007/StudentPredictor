# StudentPredictor

A program that will predict the final grade of a college student by notifying him/her about every professor's grading criteria. The program will take the course number and the professors name as an input and show him/her, how many tests, quizzes, homeworks that particular professor gives during a semester and what percentage of each category counts towards student's final grade.
